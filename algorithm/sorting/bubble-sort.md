## Bubble Sort Algorithm

We assume list is an array of n elements. We further assume that swap function swaps the values of the given array elements.

```
begin BubbleSort(list)

   for all elements of list
      if list[i] > list[i+1]
         swap(list[i], list[i+1])
      end if
   end for

   return list

end BubbleSort
```

## Pseudocode
We observe in algorithm that Bubble Sort compares each pair of array element unless the whole array is completely sorted in an ascending order. This may cause a few complexity issues like what if the array needs no more swapping as all the elements are already ascending.

To ease-out the issue, we use one flag variable swapped which will help us see if any swap has happened or not. If no swap has occurred, i.e. the array requires no more processing to be sorted, it will come out of the loop.

Pseudocode of BubbleSort algorithm can be written as follows âˆ’

```
procedure bubbleSort( list : array of items )

   loop = list.count;

   for i = 0 to loop-1 do:
      swapped = false

      for j = 0 to loop-1 do:

         /* compare the adjacent elements */
         if list[j] > list[j+1] then
            /* swap them */
            swap( list[j], list[j+1] )
            swapped = true
         end if

      end for

      /*if no number was swapped that means
      array is sorted now, break the loop.*/

      if(not swapped) then
         break
      end if

   end for

end procedure return list
```
