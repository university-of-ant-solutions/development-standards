## Source Code Management

***A source code manager (SCM) is a software tool used by teams of programmers to manage source code. SCMs are used to track revisions in software. Each revision is given a timestamp and includes the name of the person who is responsible for the change. Various revisions may be compared, stored, and merged with other revisions.***
