- Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;

- Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;

- Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;

- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,
