### What is Test Coverage ?

Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase. Test coverage is of little use as a numeric statement of how good your tests are.

If you are testing thoughtfully and well, I would expect a coverage percentage in the upper 80s or 90s.

I would say you are doing enough testing if the following is true:

- You rarely get bugs that escape into production, and
- You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.

One sign you are testing too much is if your tests are slowing you down. If it seems like a simple change to code causes excessively long changes to tests, that's a sign that there's a problem with the tests.
