## Progressive Web Apps

[Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:

- Reliable - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.

- Fast - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.

- Engaging - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.

This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user's home screen.
