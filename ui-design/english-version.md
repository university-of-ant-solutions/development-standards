- Minimalist Design


  1. SIMPLICITY.

`
Perfection is achieved when there is nothing to take away.
`

Every minimalists aims for this one thing and that is “SIMPLICITY“. Minimalism adds a sense of luxury to design. It is about focusing on essentials by keeping the elements simple and clean.

  4. WHITE SPACE.

Good minimalist design means the perfect amount of WHITE SPACE, and without White Space is not really minimalist at all. Every design element needs certain amount of room to “breath” and to balance out other elements as well.

  10. LESS IS MORE.

Good design is as little design as possible.

“LESS IS MORE” or “Less is Better” is probably the most well-known catch phrase of the Minimalist movement. Keep good readability and usability by ditching all excessiveness. Remember, minimalist design is about cutting the extra decorations and using fewest elements as possible.

Flat design

Flat design is a minimalist UI design genre, or design language, commonly used in graphical user interfaces (such as web applications and mobile apps), especially in such graphical materials as posters, arts, guide documents, publishing products.
